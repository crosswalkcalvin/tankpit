This is the first ever open-sourced [TankPit](https://www.tankpit.com/) web-scraping script! Though rudimentary, it is the first step of many, in an attempt to create a user-maintained API. You can [check out the script here](https://github.com/crosswalkcalvin/tourney-analysis/blob/master/scraper.py), or [download the data here]().

In an attempt to make immediate use of the data, I've performed an analysis of all TankPit tournaments. See findings below!

### Findings
